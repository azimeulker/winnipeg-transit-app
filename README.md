# winnipeg-transit-app
The Winnipeg Transit App utilizes the Winnipeg Transit API, allowing users to enter bus information and view schedules. Users can input their bus details to access its schedule. The app displays on-time buses in green, late buses in blue, and early-arriving buses in blue as well. This color-coded system provides users with a clear visual representation of bus statuses based on their arrival times.
